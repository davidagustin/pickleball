# Ralph Loop – Tasks Until Done

When working on a task:

1. **Loop until done** – Keep iterating on the task until it is fully complete. Do not stop with partial implementations or “good enough” states.
2. **Verify before claiming completion** – Before saying the task is done:
   - Run the relevant verification (tests, build, lint).
   - Read the output and confirm it actually passed.
   - Only then treat the task as complete.
3. **No partial completion** – Deliver the full scope. If verification fails or something is missing, fix it and re-verify; do not leave failing tests or broken builds.
4. **Use a todo list** – For multi-step work, track items (e.g. with a todo list) and ensure every item is completed before finishing.

Do not claim completion without fresh verification evidence (e.g. test/build output showing success).

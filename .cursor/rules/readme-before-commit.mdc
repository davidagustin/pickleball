# README Before Commit

Before committing changes:

1. **Look at the codebase** – Review what changed (new features, APIs, structure, scripts, or config) so docs stay in sync.
2. **Update README** – Add or edit README.md so it reflects current setup, usage, and behavior (e.g. new commands, env vars, or features). Keep it accurate and useful for someone cloning the repo.

Do this **before** staging and committing. If the change is trivial and doesn’t affect setup or usage, a README update may be unnecessary.

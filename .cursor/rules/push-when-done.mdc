# Push When Done

When you finish a task that changes files:

1. **Stage** the relevant files (`git add`).
2. **Commit** with a clear message describing the work.
3. **Push** to the remote (`git push`).

Do this as the final step before telling the user the task is complete. If the user says "don't push" or the repo has no remote, skip the push step.
